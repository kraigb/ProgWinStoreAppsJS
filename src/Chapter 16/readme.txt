The Notifications Extensions for Web folder will build a DLL for the library that can be used with the HelloTiles website. The site project already has a build DLL included in its folder.

For the HelloTiles project, you'll need Visual Studio Express for Web. Download the Web Platform Installer from http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=255386 and install the following:
  1. Microsoft WebMatrix 3
  2. PHP 5.3 or later
  3. Visual Studio Express for Web

When you first run the HelloTiles project in Visual Studio, it will also download and install various NuGet packages for WebMatrix and other modules.
