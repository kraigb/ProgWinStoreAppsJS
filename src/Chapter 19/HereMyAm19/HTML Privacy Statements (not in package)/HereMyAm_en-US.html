        <title>Here My Am! Privacy Statement</title>
    </head>
    <body style="font-family: 'Segoe UI'">
        <p>Here My Am! will attempt to access your location if you allow it, and will also use your webcam to take a picture, if you also allow it.</p>
        <p>Pictures are automatically stored in your Pictures Library in a HereMyAm folder. Your location may be saved in HereMyAm's app data for the purpose of 
            restarting the app if it's suspended and terminated.</p>
        <p>Neither pictures nor your location are transmitted elsewhere unless you explicitly invoke the Share charm and choose to share these details with a target app.</p>
        <p>No other personal information is collected, stored, or shared.</p>
        <p>And don't quote me on how legally binding all of this is...it's just a sample!</p>
