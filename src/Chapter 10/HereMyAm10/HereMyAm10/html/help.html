                    <p>Begin by tapping on the image area on the left side to take a photo with your device's camera,
                    or load one directly using the app bar commands.</p>
                    <p>Your location will be set automatically if you allow the app to use Location services. Once located, you can also
                    drag the pushpin on the map to adjust your location if desired.</p>
                    <p>If the app cannot access your location, use the Permissions settings to allow it, then use the Refresh Location
                    command on the app bar.</p>                    
                    <p>Once you have a picture and a location, invoke the Share charm to select an app through which you can share
                     the image and your coordinates.</p>
